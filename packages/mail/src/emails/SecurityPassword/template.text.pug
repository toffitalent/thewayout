| Hey !{user.firstName},

| The password for your !{config.get('company.name')} account has been updated. If you made this change, you don't need to do anything else.
|
| If you did not recently update your password and believe an unauthorized person has accessed your account, please contact support (!{config.get('company.supportEmail')}).

| Thanks,
| The !{config.get('company.name')} Team
