            employment to individuals known to have prior or current justice-involvement. We believe
            this will break down barriers to entry often faced by justice-involved individuals when

          <p>
            Upon meeting the requirements to create and creating an Employer Account, You will be
            asked to provide certain personal information to complete Your Profile. Your Profile
            consists of the information you provide on the Site. The information You share may be
            used in conjunction with the display and notice of any Job Listings You post and may
            also be used by The Way Out in presenting Your Job Listings to available and applicable
            Job Seekers. The information on Your Employer Account may be made available to third
            parties, such as potential Job Seekers and will be shared with third parties as set
            forth herein.
          </p>
          <p>
            By submitting, disclosing, or otherwise uploading information to Your Account, You are
            requesting and authorizing the Site and The Way Out to review, scan, and use the
            information You share on Your Profile. The Way Out may share Your Job Listings with Job
            Seekers and on the Site generally. You are responsible and fully liable for ensuring the
            validity of any information You share on Your Employer Account and on any Job Listing
            You create on the Site. The Way Out reserves the right to terminate Your membership and
            Account at any time under its sole discretion if any information on Your Account is
            false, misleading, fraudulent, obscene, lewd, or otherwise inappropriate for the Site
            and its users.
          </p>
          <p>
            The purpose of Employer Accounts and the Site is to allow employers and individuals
            seeking employment to connect with the goal of reducing personal biases. While The Way
            Out does not monitor Employer Accounts or regularly verify the information posted by
            Employers on the Site, Employer Accounts should be used, and Job Listings posted only by
            entities or individuals who operate legal businesses, have the capacity to offer
            employment to Job Seekers, and are currently seeking individuals for immediate
            employment. If an Employer Account is created or used for nefarious or improper means,
            The Way Out will terminate and deactivate the Account immediately upon discovery.

          <Heading mb={5}>Job Listings</Heading>
          <p>
            To receive a list of potential Job Seekers that may be qualified for Your employment
            opportunity, You must create a Job Listing in Your Employer Account. When You create or
            post a Job Listing, the Site will present several prompts for You to insert information
            relating to the employment position that You are submitting for the Job Listing. These
            categories and prompts are tools to aid in the creation of the Job Listing, however, You
            hereby agree that Your use of the tools is solely under Your sole control and at Your
            sole discretion. The Way Out will not actively partake in the creation of any Job
            Listing and disclaims any liability for the Job Listings You create or post on the Site.
            One of the tools that can be used, but is not required to be used, is the option for
            Employers to identify certain categories of criminal offenses for which the Employer has
            determined, in accordance with State, Federal, and local law, preclude the Job Seeker
            from being eligible for the respective Job Listing. If an Employer identifies one or
            more criminal offenses that would preclude a Job Seeker from being eligible for a Job
            Listing, then Job Seekers having a history of those offenses may not be able to view or
            apply for the Job Listing. When used by Employers, the criminal offense tool for a Job
            Listing has the effect of potentially denying individuals employment opportunities. As
            such, Employers are solely responsible for the use and any discriminatory effects
            stemming from their use of the tool, and The Way Out disclaims any liability stemming
            from an Employer&apos;s use of the criminal offense tool, including but not limited to
            any claims for employment discrimination, such as arrest or conviction record
            discrimination.

            The Way Out may reject or remove any Job Listing or any questions for Job Seekers for

          <p>
            Job matches are recommendations which may be presented to both You as an Employer and to
            job seekers in various formats on the Site. For example, given the unique nature of the
            Site, Job Listings may be sorted and viewable to job seekers depending on the
            selection(s) Employers may or may not opt to make as it relates to criminal
            charges/conduct when posting a Job Listing. The purpose of Employers having the option
            of limiting Job Listings to individuals without certain types of criminal offenses is to
            assist in matching the correct individuals to Job Listings while considering the
            requirements of the position and the business needs of the employers posting the
            listing. The selection of “off limits” offenses is left in the sole discretion of
            Employers. You understand and agree that The Way Out has no control or involvement in
            the content of Job Listings, including any selection by You as it relates to restricting
            consideration of any type of offense.{' '}

            The Way Out may make screening tools available to Employers for Employer use in the
            application or job listing process, including options to make selections or remove
            candidates with certain types of criminal offenses identified Job Seekers&apos; profiles
            and a third-party tool to confirm the accuracy of an applicant&apos;s reported criminal
            offenses after application. These tools are optional and shall be used by Employers at
            Your sole discretion. These tools, including any third-party verification tools are not
            controlled or monitored by The Way Out. By using any screening product made available to
            You on the Site, You agree that You have made the determination to use these tools as
            part of Your application process and the substantive decisions You make or questions You
            ask are solely determined by You, and are not the actions or decisions of The Way Out.
            You agree that You are solely responsible for the use of such screening tools in

            anti-discrimination laws such as Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended,

            similar federal, state, and local laws; and any applicable data protection or privacy
            laws. You agree to indemnify The Way Out for all claims arising out of your use of a
            screening tool, including any claims that any screening tool does not comply with
            federal, state, or local law or that your use of any screening tool results in a

            Given the unique nature of the Site, Job Listings may be sorted and viewable depending
            on the selection(s) employers may or may not opt to make as it relates to justice
            involvement, including but not limited to arrests, charges, and convictions, when
            posting a Job Listing. The purpose of employers having the option of limiting Job
            Listings to individuals without certain types of criminal offenses is to assist in
            matching the correct individuals to Job Listings while considering the requirements of
            the position and the business needs of the employers posting the listing. The selection
            of “off limits” offenses is left to the sole discretion of employers when completing the
            Job Listing. You understand and agree that The Way Out has no control or involvement in
            the content of Job Listings, including any selection by employers as it relates to

            There may be some Job Listings which You will not be able to view or for which You will
            not be eligible to apply based on selections by Employers. The Way Out has no control
