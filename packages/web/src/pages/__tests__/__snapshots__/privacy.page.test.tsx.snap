            PERSONAL DATA (PD)
          </b>
           means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (data subject); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified directly or indirectly by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier, or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural, or social identity of that natural person. PD is in many ways the same as Personally Identifiable Information (PII). However, PD is broader in scope and covers more data. (GDPR) means General Data Protection Regulation. (CCPA) means California Consumer Privacy Act. (LGPD) means Brazilian General Data Protection Law.
